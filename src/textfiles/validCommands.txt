“Brad? You ask, incredulous. You didn’t expect to see any of your classmates here, much less the most obnoxious one in your year.
“What are you doing here? Are you a part of this? Did you take Doug??” Your voice raises in anger, and Brad’s is equally heated when he responds.
“What? Screw you, man! You can’t come in here and accuse me of taking your stupid dog without any evidence!”
He storms off, leaving you alone in the front room, with nothing but POSTERS and the oversized FRONT DESK for company. Behind the desk, there is a DOOR.

You shuffle through the papers laying haphazardly on the desk.
Registration forms, reminders to clean the showers... and a picture of your dog!
This looks like it was taken in your backyard. Hm. You’ll be keeping this.

You wonder who this gym bag belongs to. Brad? It must be his, since he seems to be the only person around.
You glance around to make sure you’re alone before opening it.
Deodorant, a towel, a change of clothes... crammed in the bottom, you find a crumpled post-it note.
“145 Willow Lane. Get it done!” you read. That’s your address! This seems like some quality evidence. You think you’ll keep it.

The shelves crowding the wall are absolutely packed with gear.
You don’t know how you’d find anything here. But as you’re turning away, a glint catches your eye.
A can of spray paint! The color looks the same as the symbol left in your yard. Curious.
You stash it in your bag for later.

There’s a cord hanging out of a drawer, which you open to find a key.
“This could come in handy,” you think to yourself as you slip it into your pocket.

Brad stands to meet you as you approach.

“How could I? I didn’t even know you had a stupid dog.”
You recall the PAINT, NOTE, and PICTURE you found earlier. Might be time to pull them out.

There may be something useful behind the hostess stand. You take a peek, and find a stack of menus.

“Beauty Blend”? “Lover’s Luxury”? Something’s fishy about this.
You think you’ll hang onto one of these.

"This is just a regular old restaurant, and it’s time for you to go.” You think not.
You recall the strange MENU, the business CONTRACT, and the hormone VIAL you’ve collected that prove this isn’t a regular restaurant.

“What do you want? You think you can just come in here with no invitation?"
"I’ll have you know, this is a clinic for terminally ill patients, and you are trespassing!”
You recall the strange POSTER, BROCHURE, and PAPERWORK you’ve come across and are ready to challenge her.

As he looks at the picture, you see Brad’s confidence falter.
“You went through my stuff? Okay, so maybe I saw your dog before.
That doesn’t mean I took him! You don’t have anything to tie that to anyone here.”
You think for a moment. Is there proof that the Invisible Org are the culprits?

You feel that you’re nearing victory. Just one last move....

Sounds good to you. “Okay. Show me where to go.” Brad points to a set of stairs going UP in the back.
